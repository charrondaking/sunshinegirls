			<p>That’s just what we need, another fashion doll. There’s Barbie, Moxie Girls, Liv Dolls, All the Disney Princess and now the Bratz are back! So why Sunshine Girls; because these are dolls for all of our daughters and they have just enough old school mixed-in so parents aren’t tortured by the whole experience. Barbie has an ethnic friend but who is she, does she have a name or is she just a painted version of Barbie to get African Americans to spend money on Barbie Products? This isn’t the case with the Sunshine Girls.</p><br>

			<p>The Sunshine Girls speak to all our daughters, whispering in their ears how beautiful they are…’as is’, no changes required. And with such strong friendship ties, it’s not longer about race and all about Lizzy, Aster, Lark, Veronica and Lily.</p><br>

		
			<p>Fashion dolls have a short lifespan among girls ages 5-14, after approximately age 8, young ladies look to bigger and better forms of entertainment, that’s how Sunshine Girls are unique. It’s not just about the dolls, there’s also great products and engaging software that will keep young ladies from all walks of life entertained throughout middle school.</p><br>

			<p>Each Fashion Doll will contain a free DVD introducing each unique and sassy character. Special bonds have been formed between the dolls, for instants, Aster and Veronica are inseparable and these friendships are fully developed on the DVD. Any young lady who buys an Aster doll will want to purchase a Veronica doll as well after watching the DVD.</p><br>

			<p>No one doll is more important than the other. They all have a strong presents and personality. When you walk thru the toy section and see the Sunshine Girl Logo, you automatically know the product and when you look to see which young lady is under the Sunshine Logo, you also automatically know her name who she is.</p><br>

		
			<p>The free DVD not only introduce each doll but also strongly promotes the website which has great products for sale and interactive games such as Aster’s Realm where young ladies can face-off with Aster. It’s a skateboard competition for Aster and her opponent(s) who can choose another Sunshine Girl to race Aster or build their own character and chose their weapon such as, skateboard, roller blades, bike, etc. Aster gear will be for sale on this particular section of the sight.</p><br>

			<p>Also on the website is Veronica’s Boutique where you can upload a photograph of yourself along with measurements and help Veronica Design a look just for you. All selections will be made from fabric samples and patterns in stock and that design and be created and purchased.</p><br>

			<p>Sunshine Girls has the potential for so many product lines that will keep so many young ladies entertained for years to come. </p><br>
